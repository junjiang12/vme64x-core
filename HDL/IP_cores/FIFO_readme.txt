FIFO.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

FIFO.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

FIFO.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

FIFO.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

FIFO.xise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

FIFO_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

FIFO_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

FIFO_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.
